# Erie MCA Demo — Demo Narrative Talking Points

executive_summary:
  opening_line: >
    Erie invests $100M annually across 13 marketing channels to drive auto
    policy growth. Today, last-click attribution tells you that Paid Search
    is your best channel. But we both know that your 12,000 independent agents
    close 85% of your business. Something doesn't add up.
  transition_to_shapley: >
    Watch what happens when we apply fair attribution — the same cooperative
    game theory that powers Google's own Data-Driven Attribution — to your full
    channel ecosystem, including your agent network.
  closing_hook: >
    The question isn't whether your attribution is wrong — it's how much
    money you're leaving on the table because of it.

attribution_comparison:
  key_callout: >
    Notice how agents jump from single digits to over 30% of attribution credit.
    That's not model bias — it's Shapley's efficiency axiom ensuring every
    conversion is fairly allocated.
  objection_handler_ga4: >
    GA4's data-driven attribution only sees digital touchpoints. For Erie,
    that's 30-40% of the picture. Our model sees the full journey — including
    the agent interaction that GA4 doesn't know about.
  estimation_humility: >
    We should be honest — Gordon et al. found that observational MTA can produce
    errors of 5-10× in absolute ad effects. That's why we show you 15+ models
    and a triangulation roadmap — no single model is trustworthy alone.

journey_paths:
  key_insight: >
    The highest-converting customer journey follows the pattern
    Display/Social → Search → Agent → Bind. This cooperating pattern
    accounts for a significant share of all policy binds.
  agent_multiplier: >
    Any journey that includes an agent touchpoint converts at 4-5×
    the rate of pure digital journeys. Agents aren't just closing —
    they're the force multiplier for your entire marketing investment.

budget_optimizer:
  cfo_language: >
    At Erie's estimated average premium of $1,200 per auto policy, the
    projected additional binds represent meaningful first-year premium.
    Over a 5-year average policyholder lifetime, the value compounds.
  reallocation_insight: >
    Shifting 15% of branded search spend to display/social projects a
    15-25% improvement in cost-per-bind — without increasing total budget.

identity_resolution:
  pitch: >
    Identity resolution is the foundation that makes multi-touch attribution
    possible. Without it, the same customer appears as three different people
    across desktop, mobile, and agent interactions.

model_validation:
  credibility: >
    Every model in our arsenal passes formal axiom compliance testing.
    Shapley values sum exactly to total conversions. Markov models produce
    consistent rankings. Cross-model agreement (Spearman ρ > 0.70) confirms
    these results aren't artifacts of method choice.

technical_appendix:
  triangulation_roadmap: >
    Phase 1 (now): Multi-touch attribution for tactical channel optimization.
    Phase 2 (6 months): Media mix modeling via Google Meridian for strategic
    allocation across Erie's 12-state footprint.
    Phase 3 (12 months): Incrementality experiments via geo-testing for
    causal ground truth. This is the industry gold standard.
